# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative project management approach centered on customer-first principles, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions to deliver cross-functional projects efficiently. The core lifecycle includes initiation (defining problem statements and stakeholders), planning (creating backlogs, estimates, and release plans), execution (building and testing in sprints with daily standups and demos), release (deploying and verifying features), and retrospectives for continuous improvement. Key artifacts like project charters, risk registers, and acceptance criteria ensure transparency, while workflows emphasize breaking work into shippable increments, managing dependencies through project boards, and using checklists for planning and execution to minimize risks and maintain alignment.

Central to OctoAcme's processes are defined personas and roles that promote collaboration and accountability. Product Managers focus on defining outcomes, prioritizing backlogs, and validating solutions through metrics and user research. Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and communications, facilitating meetings and status reporting. Developers implement features, write tests, and participate in reviews to ensure reliable code. QA/Testing validates quality and acceptance criteria, with stakeholders providing inputs and approvals. These roles align on goals like reducing cycle time, maximizing value, and maintaining psychological safety for feedback.

Communication strategies at OctoAcme prioritize regular cadence and escalation to keep all parties informed and issues resolved swiftly. Weekly syncs between PMs and Product Managers, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly stakeholder updates ensure ongoing alignment, supported by templates for status reports and incident communications. Risk management involves maintaining a register with assessments of impact and likelihood, monitored weekly, with escalation paths from team-level triage to sponsor-level decisions. For security or high-impact issues, specific runbooks guide responses.

Quality assurance practices integrate testing and reviews throughout the process, from unit and integration tests in CI pipelines to end-to-end smoke tests and manual QA for critical features. Code reviews require approvals and link to acceptance criteria, while security scanning and high test coverage reduce defects. Execution checklists enforce conventions like small PRs and regular demos, and retrospectives capture learnings to refine processes, fostering a culture of iterative delivery and measurable impact.
